Some general notes and info about learning resources I liked using till now

Yesterday I was stuck with an issue where in the Layers Preview in GeoServer using the Openlayers format would
display an empty map. After much work, I figured out that probelem was that GeoServer needs to have only specific Java versions 
to work, and the Java JRE version I had was Java 16 which is not compatible with GeoServer. I switch my Java version to Java 8 and
the issue was resolved. Here is link to GeoServer's User manual page for compatible Java versions: 
https://docs.geoserver.org/latest/en/user/production/java.html

Here are some extra learning resources I am using along with resources provided in the orienation PDF:

For Bootstrap I found a really great online course that teaches by building projects (I find doing projects very helpful). However it is based on an older 
version of Bootstrap so there might be some slight differences if you're using a newer version.

For Flask there is a popular playlist among Flask learners by Corey Schafer on youtube. I found this playlist to be easier to understand than the 
official documentation:

Also as a general reference for JQuery and Bootstrap I am using w3schools.com

Thank you
