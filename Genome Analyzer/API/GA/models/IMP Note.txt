to add more tables to the database:
	1- create the table in a .py file in models folder
	2- go to __init__.py which is in "GA" folder and import the model you created under the section "importing models"
	3- via the terminal, go to API folder then type "python"
	4- type "from GA import db"
	5- type "db.create_all()"
	6- type exit() to exit python shell

This will add the tables that we will create to the database without affecting previous tables or data

Youc can use the file Staff.py as a template for upcoming tables
