to add more tables to the database:
	1- create the table in a .py file in models folder
	2- via the terminal, go to API folder then type "python"
	3- type "from GA import db"
	4- type "db.create_all()"

This will add the tables that we will create later on to the database

Youc can use the file Staff.py as a template for upcoming tables
